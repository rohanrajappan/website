<h1>Welcome to my Website!</h1>

<h3>I&#39;m Rohan Rajappan--</h3>

<h4>A first-year university student interested in Computer Science and Materials Science, specifically interested in the convergence of AI and Materials Science and Engineering with big data. I am currently looking for opportunities for Summer 2024.</h4>

<h4 style="color:SlateBlue;">Please excuse the appearance of this website as I work to build a more dynamic and professional one! I am currently preparing for finals, so this project has taken a backseat.</h4>

<p><strong>A brief bio:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>This website started as me wanting to learn HTML and finding a fun and rewarding or lasting way to do it. I planned originally to learn HTML and CSS, then Javascript, but I have fallen through many rabbit holes, and found a lot of new things! My plan is still to learn those other two languages, but right now I am incredibly interested in understanding as much as I can about web development. I originally started playing with AWS, but that was quite a lot to try to understand, so right now I want to work towards more basic things and things like WordPress, and then eventually start to understand what AWS can provide, including services that don&#39;t relate to web development. As a student, I am still extremely interested in AI and how it &quot;thinks&quot;, but I enjoy rounding myself out in all of these areas, since they can provide me with useful skills. I&#39;ve had my fair share of headaches through hosting and the pain of having to Google every other word of an article, but I have enjoyed being able to learn even the smallest part about creating a website.</p>
